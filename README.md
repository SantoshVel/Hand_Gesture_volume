# Hand_Gesture_volume
This project is a real-time hand gesture-based volume control system that allows users to adjust their system volume by simply moving their fingers. Using Computer Vision and MediaPipe Hand Tracking, the program detects the distance between the thumb and index finger and maps it to volume levels, making volume control touchless and intuitive.
